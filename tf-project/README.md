üåê Topics Covered:

- Creating an AWS VPC: We'll start by setting up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), the fundamental building block of our AWS infrastructure.

- Configuring Subnets: We'll define public and private subnets to segregate our resources for security and performance.

- Creating an Application Load Balancer (ALB): Learn how to set up an ALB to distribute incoming traffic to our EC2 instances.

- Setting Up an S3 Bucket: We'll create an S3 bucket for storing and serving static assets.

- Routing Traffic with a Route Table: Configure a custom route table to control how traffic flows within the VPC.

- Attaching an Internet Gateway: Enable external internet access to our resources by attaching an internet gateway.

- Launching EC2 Instances: We'll launch two EC2 instances in the private subnet and configure them for our application.

- Using Terraform: Throughout the tutorial, we'll be using Terraform, a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, to define and provision our AWS resources.
